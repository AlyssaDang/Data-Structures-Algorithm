0. Linked-List:   A linear structure containing nodes, which has 1+ pointer variable that references its place in the structure.
                  The first node is called the HEAD and the last node is called the (optional) TAIL.

                  Singly Linked-List: Each node contains a singular pointer to the *next node.

                  Doubly Linked-List: Each node contains a pointer to the *next node and the *previous node

                  Circular Linked-List: This can be singly linked or doubly linked. 
                                        The last node's *next pointer points to HEAD and 
                                        the HEAD's *previous pointer points to the TAIL.
